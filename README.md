# Mini-Kernel [Name Pending]
This is the construction site of the upcoming RV32 mini kernel "name not yet specified", hooray!
Not a whole lot is working right now, and with not a whole lot I mean we are booting into SM
and configuring a timer to trigger a trap every second, exciting isn't it? But worry not, more is yet to come!
